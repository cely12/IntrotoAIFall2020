    "# CSCI 3202: Intro to AI - Fall 2020 Practicum 1\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Monday November 2**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distributions or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your midterm exam. So, the instructional team will be much less helpful than we typically are with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.  We will happily discuss ideas on your paper, however.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is because we want to see how you approach the kinds of problems you will encounter in the wild, where it will not always be clear what sort of tests/methods should be applied. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.\n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on this practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By submitting this assignment, you agree to abide by the rules given above.**\n",
    "\n",

    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- You may not use late days on the practicums nor can you drop your practicum grades. \n",
    "- If you have a question for us, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If we decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class, then we will add it to a Practicum clarifications thread. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. The practicum is designed to be completed using only the packages in the first given code cell.\n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Canvas.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",
    "- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n",

    "In this exercise, we're going to be using simulated annealing to find solutions to the traveling salesman problem.Your two helper functions in part A should help!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we model a salesman that tries to \"reach\" each city on the graph to sell their wares.  As an algorithm, the goal of the traveling salesman problem is to find the path that:\n",
    "    - has the lowest total edge length (or path cost)\n",
    "    - hits each and every vertex/node exactly once\n",
    "    - the salesman may travel directly between *any* two cities (you will need more edges than you constructed in part A!)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use simulated annealing.  This means you need to come up with both a temperature function and a probability of acceptance function.  There is no guidance on these functions beyond:\n",
    "    - Given a path or solution to the problem, the temperature function proposes a new solution.\n",
    "    The new solutions should become more and more like the input solutions over time/as you run more iterations\n",
    "    - Given two solutions, the annealing algorithm will always accept one with a shorter path cost, and will have some probability that scales with temperature/iterations and becomes less and less likely to accept a new solution with longer path cost.\n",
    "    - All proposed solutions should pass through every node.\n",
    "    - There are many methods to \"adjust\" old solutions to propose new ones.  You should consider moving a single node to another location in the list, moving entire substrings to other locations, reversing the order of substrings, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For any temperature/probability function pair, make sure you run annealing for sufficiently different initial conditions to generate a small sample of \"final solution lengths\" and \"number of iterations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Typeset and describe in exact detail how you chose and implemented temperature and probability functions in the markdown cell below.\n"

    "For my implementation, I implemented two sets of schedule and probability functions. One of the sets is the one Zach provided us in `CSCI 3202_HillClimbing_SimulatedAnnealing_Solutions`. I also made my own set of functions. I tried to alter the C and p values to make my function less likely to accept worse paths quicker, to see what effect that had on my solutions. In terms of the probability function, I just divided the `exp` call by two, which in essence just shifts the curve to the right if we were looking at it graphically. You could greatly vary the schedule and probability functions by changing the C and/or p values, or by going for a different setup entriely. I kept the `exp` aspect of the probability due to the nature of its change over time meaning that solutions are accepted with lower and lower probability over time. You could also vary path randomization using some of the suggestions above, namely moving single nodes or entire substrings to different locations. You could also change how different proposed solutions are over time. For example, reversing substrings of less and less length over time, or moving substrings of less and less length to random places. This could help you to zero in on a solution, or it could conversely get you stuck in a local minimum easier. Below I have included the average path length of 10 runs of three combinations of functions each: one of my functions, one of Zach's, and one of one function each."

    "As the word continually transitions and modernizes into the future, concerns surrounding the ethics of many of humanity’s frontiers have been raised by some of the world’s smartest minds. One such field around which many doubts have been voiced is the field of artificial intelligence or AI. Few would argue that artificial intelligence cannot be a great tool for society if used properly. The key to making AI a useful tool in the future is regulating and monitoring usage, however this task is easier said than done. Regulating artificial intelligence will require enough freedom for technological advancements, but enough regulations to keep society at large safe and comfortable with the technology around them. <br>\n",
    "\tFor the average citizen, their current interactions with the type of AI we generally tend to think of when we hear the term are few and far between. Few Americans have intelligent robots or self driving cars in their house or garage for example. The majority of an average citizen’s encounters come from hidden software that we tend to forget, things as common as predictive text features on a smartphone. For this reason, many of the issues everyday citizens will be facing regarding AI will have to deal with security and privacy of data. Common forms of AI that deal with personal privacy of data are facial recognition, email categorization, and predictive text [1, 4]. AI was chosen to accomplish these tasks since it would make them simpler and easier on the user than doing them without artificial intelligence. For example, facial recognition has simplified the routine task of unlocking your phone. The ability to unlock your new iPhone just by looking at it simplifies a process that before required the actual touch of a finger or even worse, the typing of a passcode. Email services can categorize emails for us, and predictive text makes it easier to text in a hurry. Humans can accomplish every one of these tasks, but AI was chosen in order to accelerate and simplify the task for the user. <br>\n",
    "\tDespite each of the above tasks being simplified with the use of artificial intelligence, there are unavoidable concerns surrounding the data made available to the AI during the course of completing the tasks. The general public always wants their data to be secure, yet in order for AI to work to the best of its ability, the system needs large amounts of quality data [1]. This means private data and information may be vulnerable to leaks if there is a problem with the artificial intelligence system. One possible solution to combat such a problem would be to regulate the use of AI. Many federal agencies such as the FDA and the EPA enact the majority of public policy put into law in the United States today, due in large part to the fact that full-time policy makers work in these agencies [4]. Many high profile executives in the tech industry such as Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk have even expressed a firm desire for there to be a government agency dealing solely with the regulation of artificial intelligence [4, 2]. With that being said, establishing a strict set of national or even worldwide regulations on AI is much simpler on paper than it would be in reality. Regulations around the world may look very different from continent to continent and even country to country. Policy makers around the world need to know about the goals and needs of AI around the world, as this may differ greatly from country to country [1]. <br>\n",
    "\tAnother big factor in the question of AI regulations is the question of ethics. The main argument against the regulation of artificial intelligence is that AI is not currently at a point where it needs to be regulated, and the resources required would outweigh the benefit at the current moment [3]. This is less of an argument against restrictions themselves, but more of an argument against them right now. In general, it is agreed among scholars that AI needs regulation in the future, however it is hard to solidify these restrictions at the moment [3]. Using the five sources of ethical standards [5], we are able to see some of the reasons why many scholars agree on the matter. Using the utilitarian approach, the outcome that provides the greatest amount of good over harm would be a case where regulations on AI limit the amount of harm that can be done. One may argue that by limiting the bad that can be done we must also limit the good that can be done. This might be true, but well-defined restrictions in the future will be formed with the goal of only restricting harmful uses of AI. When taking the rights approach into mind, limiting AI results in the greatest amount of personal freedom. According to the rights approach, one has a right to personal privacy and freedom, things that as discussed above could be compromised by unregulated AI. Using the fairness or justice approach, AI should not be regulated. The better the system is, the more it should be able to accomplish, without limitations. There should be no penalty for being better at extracting personal information, for example. While taking the common good approach into account, AI should be regulated as to preserve the common good of society. AI that can do major damage such as a mass-killing machine needs to be regulated for the common good of society. Lastly, looking at the virtue approach, AI regulations should be put in place in certain situations. Acting to the highest potential of our character would not be harming others on a large scale, and thus AI built with such a goal in mind should be restricted. Using the five pillars of ethical standards, we can conclude that AI should be regulated in cases that would cause great harm to society and its members, but left alone when it helps society to reach its full potential or furthers our general understanding. <br>\n",
    "\tWhether the governments and leaders of the world decide to regulate artificial intelligence or not, the decision will have a lasting impact on the future of humanity. Unregulated AI could reach its full potential, in both good and malicious uses. The benefits would be maximized, no matter what the end goal of the AI is. It would not be surprising to me to see this debate over whether AI should be regulated and the ethical debate behind it discussed above come to the forefront of policy makers’ minds in the decades to come. In general, I would say that this debate over whether artificial intelligence should be restricted is fairly representative. It is an increasingly common debate that I saw many articles on in my research for this paper. I believe such debates will only become more prevalent as AI expands and improves in the future, and I believe that artificial intelligence should be regulated. For the most part, artificial intelligence is used solely for good in the world, but it only takes one case of AI being used for malice to cause a real tragedy. If we are not careful, artificial intelligence may surpass human intelligence by a vast margain, and may be able to perform unintended tasks with very grave consequences.\n"
